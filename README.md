## Usage of the Virtual Environment

### Activating the Virtual Environment

The virtual environment `osia_ia_env` is created in the user's home directory to avoid cluttering the Git project folder. To activate it, use the following command:

```bash
source ~/.osia_ia_env/bin/activate


### 

When the environment is activated, you will see (osia_ia_env) at the beginning of the terminal prompt, indicating that you are working within the environment.
Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working, you can deactivate the environment by running:

deactivate

Benefits of the osia_ia_env Virtual Environment

This environment is specifically configured for data science and machine learning, which allows you to:

    Perform data analysis efficiently and reproducibly.
    Develop and train machine learning and deep learning models.
    Create interactive visualizations and exploratory data analysis.
    Run and share projects in JupyterLab for interactive analysis.

This setup provides a strong foundation for advanced AI projects, from data exploration to predictive model development.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or if a library does not install correctly, make sure pip is updated, and rerun the script. You can also check the logs to identify any specific errors during the installation of particular libraries.
